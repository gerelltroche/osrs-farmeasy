# FarmEasy

A tool for [Old School Runescape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/).

## Why?

When I started leveling farming I realized that although there are many YouTube guides out there. 
None of them can dynamically tell you what to do/bring depending on what unlocks you have and what
farming level you have. This tool does just that.

###Ideas for the future:
* Add profit tooltip for each run using Grand Exchange data.
* Push notification option for growth
* Running tally of all runs generated
